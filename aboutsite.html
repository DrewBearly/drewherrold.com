        <p>This site was created in April 2016 as a personal portfolio and central site for my projects.</p>
        <p>The basic templates for the site came from <a href="http://pixelarity.com">pixelarity.com</a>, and any pictures I was too lazy to change came from <a href="http://unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a></p>
        <p>All other images, idea, works, and their derivatives, unless otherwise noted, are <strong>Copyright &copy;2016 Andrew Herrold</strong></p>
